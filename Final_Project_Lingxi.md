# My Story

My story starts with an interesting question that may probably address interests among a great number of people. The question is, “Who is most likely to win the next year’s Oscar directing award?”


The prediction for the next Oscar winner will be based on the winning trends through past winning records. By illustrating the past records, existing data, and analyzing the winning trends of Oscar’s directing awards through the 90 years, past 50 years, past 20 years, and past 10 years, I will make a prediction for the next Oscar directing winner with gender, age, race, cooperators, film types, opening date, production company, etc.


# Outline

1. Ask the question, “Who is most likely to win the next year’s Oscar directing award?” At this phase, the audiences may have some interests in my topic

2. Why important? —— Users’ Stories 

- As an audience, I want to get to know the history, used trends, recent trends, and changes of the academy awards so that I can know more about the American film industry as well as the entertainment leading trends.

- As a filmmaker, I want to obtain a general concept of the winning trends so that I can select next year’s production theme and have more chances to win the academy award.

- As a awards bidder, I want to know the trends and the changes in the awards do that I can win money in the gambling.

3. Introduce the data resources as well as the researches. After explaining the topic, I am going to introduce the researches I had as well as my data resources—where does data come from, where to find the data, the academic accuracy of the data, and the reason for why I take four groups(past 10 years, 20 years, 50 years, and total 90 years.)

4. After introducing the data, I am going to show the data visualizations on different aspects of my research(gender, age, race, cooperators, film types, opening date, produce company, etc.) What’s more, I am also going to analyze which aspect matters most, or what other factors may affect the results(such as political issues, society interests, worldwide incidents, etc.)

5. Conclusion and final prediction. Based on the analysis above, I will come up with a conclusion and the final prediction.

The story arc that combines four parts is as follows.

# Data

My data sources come from two different places. One is the Academy Awards official website. The other is DataHub.

The official website has an Academy Awards Database which contains the official record of past Academy Award winners and nominees. The data is complete through the 2018 (91st) Academy Awards, presented on February 24, 2019. Besides, if you click on the comment box next to each winner, it will lead you to the acceptance speech page, and the information of the film is also shown on the page.

Although Academy Awards Database is comprehensive, there is no excel document that can be downloaded through the official website. However, my second resource, DataHub, is providing excel document with those basic information from the year 1927 to the year 2018.

To finish my project, I am going to use the excel from DataHub and add the data of the year 2019 by myself. What’s more, the records such as film opening dates, film types, and race are also not available in the excel document. I will enter those data by looking up the information through the official website.


# Method and Medium

I am going to use Shorthand to present my final project. I will utilize the icons, film historical pictures, and film posters to decorate the background of the storyline. To make my story more acceptable, I will try to insert fewer words and use more visualizations.
